# INTERNBOOT - Internship Projects

This repository contains projects completed during my Software Development Internship, showcasing hands-on experience in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning. All projects are implemented using Python and popular libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NLP libraries.

Projects
1. Stock Price Prediction

Predict future stock prices using historical data with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

Tech/Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib

Features:

Historical stock data collection using yfinance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and moving averages

Time-series forecasting using LSTM

Prediction visualization and actual vs predicted comparison

2. Disease Prediction

Predict the likelihood of a disease based on patient data using machine learning models.

Tech/Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Training and testing with ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix visualization

3. Sentiment Analysis

Analyze the sentiment of text data (positive, negative, neutral) using NLP techniques.

Tech/Tools: Python, NLTK, TextBlob, pandas, matplotlib

Features:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming)

Sentiment scoring using NLP libraries

Visualization of sentiment distribution

Key Highlights

Hands-on experience in Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, and NLP.

Projects demonstrate practical implementation of time-series forecasting, classification, and text analysis.

Strong foundation in Python programming and data visualization.
